# voltdb-py3-driver
This is a hacky port of [VoltDB Python driver](https://github.com/VoltDB/voltdb/blob/master/lib/python/voltdbclient.py) 
to Pythob3. It is not aiming to be a fully correct pythonic implementation, merely a crude port over to make VoltDB 
usable in a Python3 application. This is not a reference implementation by any means. Do not use unless you're ready
to maintain this yourself.
